# Weather Assist

## Overview
Weather Assist is a personalized online hub designed to allow users to view the weather of desired cities around the world. This is a front-end application which utilizes React, Redux, and more, to access the Dark Sky Weather API to load the current weather of a location based on latitude and longitude.
